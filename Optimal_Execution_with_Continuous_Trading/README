A fundamental challenge in finance is how an agent can effectively buy or sell a large volume of shares while minimizing the adverse price movements caused by their own trades. This involves balancing a trade-off between **price impact** (trading quickly, which can move the market price) and **price risk** (taking longer, which can expose the agent to market fluctuations).

### 1. **Understanding Execution Costs**

**Execution cost** is defined as the difference between a benchmark price and the actual price (measured as the average price per share). When the benchmark is the asset's mid-price at the time the order is placed (known as the **arrival price**), this execution cost is referred to as the **implementation shortfall** or **slippage**.

### 2. **Key Variables and Notations**

- **\( V_t \)**: Trading rate
- **\( Q_t \)**: Agent’s inventory
- **\( S_t \)**: Mid-price process
- **\( \hat{S_t} \)**: Execution price
- **\( X_t \)**: Agent’s cash
- **\( g \)**: Permanent price impact
- **\( f \)**: Temporary price impact

Price impact is often assumed to be linear with respect to trading speed: \( f(V_t) = k \cdot V_t \). It's important to note that price impact isn't constant throughout the day: it's highest in the morning, stabilizes during the day, and decreases toward market close.

### 3. **Formulas and Dynamics**

- **Inventory Control**: \( dQ_t = \pm V_t \cdot dt \)
- **Mid-Price Process**: \( dS_t = \pm g(V_t) + O \cdot dW_t \)
- **Execution Price**: \( \hat{S_t} = S_t \pm (\text{half spread} + f(V_t)) \)
- **Cash Process**: \( dX_t = \hat{S_t} \cdot V_t \cdot dt \)

### 4. **Liquidation Strategies**

#### **4.1. Liquidation Without Penalties (Temporary Impact Only)**
The agent uses market orders to liquidate \( n \) shares over a period from \( t=0 \) to \( T \). The optimal trading speed is:

\[
\text{Optimal speed} = \frac{n}{T}
\]

This approach follows the **Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP)** strategy.

#### **4.2. Optimal Acquisition with Terminal Penalty and Temporary Impact**
The agent can pursue strategies that may not fully meet the inventory target (\( Q_T < n \)). In such cases, any remaining shortfall is covered by a market order, incurring an additional penalty \( a \). The optimal trading speed is:

\[
\text{Optimal speed} = \frac{n}{T + \frac{k}{a}}
\]

As the penalty \( a \) approaches infinity, this strategy also converges to the TWAP. Regardless of the values of \( a \) and \( k \), it's optimal to leave some shares for execution at the terminal date.

### 5. **Liquidation with Permanent Price Impact**

In scenarios where both temporary and permanent price impacts are considered, along with a running inventory penalty, the optimal trading speed remains proportional to the current inventory level. However, the proportionality factor now depends non-linearly on time. This running inventory penalty isn't a direct financial cost but reflects the agent's urgency to complete the trade.

### 6. **Execution with Exponential Utility Maximization**

So far, the agent has been considered risk-neutral, aiming to maximize expected terminal wealth. If the agent is risk-averse and follows an exponential utility function, their behavior is similar to a risk-neutral agent who is averse to holding inventory.

### 7. **Non-Linear Price Impact Models**

While a linear price impact function is a common approximation, some studies suggest that a power-law model, with a power less than one, might better fit real market data. However, the complexity added by moving away from a linear model may not justify its use. As the power-law parameter decreases, implying less price impact for similar-sized orders, the agent tends to liquidate faster to minimize inventory risk without significantly increasing temporary market impact. Essentially, this behavior reflects a higher urgency to trade, even when using a linear impact model.
