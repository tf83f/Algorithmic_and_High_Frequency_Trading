## Overview

A fundamental challenge in finance is how an agent can effectively buy or sell a large volume of shares while minimizing adverse price movements caused by their own trades. This involves balancing a trade-off between **price impact** (trading quickly, which can move the market price) and **price risk** (taking longer, which can expose the agent to market fluctuations).

## Execution Costs

**Execution cost** is defined as the difference between a benchmark price and the actual price (measured as the average price per share). When the benchmark is the asset's mid-price at the time the order is placed (known as the **arrival price**), this execution cost is referred to as the **implementation shortfall** or **slippage**.

## Key Variables and Notations

- **\( V_t \)**: Trading rate
- **\( Q_t \)**: Agent’s inventory
- **\( S_t \)**: Mid-price process
- **\( \hat{S_t} \)**: Execution price
- **\( X_t \)**: Agent’s cash
- **\( g \)**: Permanent price impact
- **\( f \)**: Temporary price impact

Price impact is often assumed to be linear with respect to trading speed: 

\[
f(V_t) = k \cdot V_t
\]

Price impact varies throughout the day: it is highest in the morning, stabilizes during the day, and decreases toward market close.

## Formulas and Dynamics

- **Inventory Control**:  
  \[
  dQ_t = \pm V_t \cdot dt
  \]

- **Mid-Price Process**:  
  \[
  dS_t = \pm g(V_t) + O \cdot dW_t
  \]

- **Execution Price**:  
  \[
  \hat{S_t} = S_t \pm (\text{half spread} + f(V_t))
  \]

- **Cash Process**:  
  \[
  dX_t = \hat{S_t} \cdot V_t \cdot dt
  \]

## Liquidation Strategies

### 1. Liquidation Without Penalties (Temporary Impact Only)

The agent uses market orders to liquidate \( n \) shares over a period from \( t=0 \) to \( T \). The optimal trading speed is:

\[
\text{Optimal speed} = \frac{n}{T}
\]

This strategy follows the **Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP)**.

### 2. Optimal Acquisition with Terminal Penalty and Temporary Impact

The agent may use strategies that don't meet the total inventory target (\( Q_T < n \)). Any shortfall is covered by a market order, incurring an additional penalty \( a \). The optimal trading speed is:

\[
\text{Optimal speed} = \frac{n}{T + \frac{k}{a}}
\]

As the penalty \( a \) approaches infinity, this strategy converges to TWAP. For any values of \( a \) and \( k \), it's optimal to leave some shares for execution at the terminal date.

## Liquidation with Permanent Price Impact

When both temporary and permanent price impacts are considered, along with a running inventory penalty, the optimal trading speed is proportional to the current inventory level. However, the proportionality factor depends non-linearly on time. This inventory penalty reflects the agent's urgency to complete the trade and is not a direct financial cost.

## Execution with Exponential Utility Maximization

If the agent is risk-neutral and aims to maximize expected terminal wealth, they will execute trades in a manner similar to a risk-averse agent who is inventory-averse. When considering risk aversion with exponential utility, the behavior aligns with that of a risk-neutral but inventory-averse agent.

## Non-Linear Price Impact Models

Though a linear price impact function is common, some studies suggest that a power-law model (with a power less than one) may better reflect actual market data. However, the complexity of non-linear models might outweigh the benefits. As the power-law parameter decreases, implying less price impact for similar-sized orders, the agent tends to liquidate faster to minimize inventory risk without significantly increasing temporary market impact. Essentially, this makes the agent behave as if they have a higher urgency to trade, even when using a linear impact model.
